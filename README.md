# Lolin D1 mini wifi clock with pictures

Got these 0,66" oled shields for Lolin/Wemos D1 mini. These are tiny! Almost too tiny. 20/20 vision is recommended.

To test the display I made this small Wifi-clock with cute pig on day time and of course night owl during night time. Works just like my other wifi clocks.
